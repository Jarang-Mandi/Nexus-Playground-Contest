# ðŸŽ¯ Scratch Card Game â€“ Inspired by Childhood Lotteries
Hi! I made this little scratch card game because I was inspired by the lottery tickets I used to buy from street vendors when I was in elementary school. Simple times, fun memories. So I thought, hey, why not turn that into a game?

This gameâ€™s not super fancy, I'm still learning ðŸ˜…
No leaderboard, no crazy features. Just pure scratch-and-hope-for-the-best fun!

##ðŸŽ® How to Play
There are 3 difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard.

ðŸŸ¢ Easy â€“ 3x3 grid, filled with emojis and 1 bomb. Just donâ€™t scratch the bomb!

ðŸŸ¡ Medium â€“ 4x4 grid, also with 1 bomb. A little more tricky.

ðŸ”´ Hard â€“ 6x6 grid, now with 2 bombs. Good luck avoiding them!

Your goal? Reveal all the emojis without hitting any bomb. Thatâ€™s it! ðŸŽ‰

##ðŸ’» Try It Out
Play the game and see how far you can go!
Also, I'm joining the Nexus Playground 2 contest with this, so if you like it â€” support me! ðŸ™Œ

##ðŸ§  Just a heads-up...
I'm still a noob ðŸ˜… and learning as I go. So yeah, the code is pretty simple and might be a bit messy.
But feel free to grab the source code, play around with it, and make it better â€” remix away! ðŸ˜„
